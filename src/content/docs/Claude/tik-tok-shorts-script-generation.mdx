I've created a 30-second TikTok/Shorts script explaining Gitea!

**Key elements:**
- **Strong hook** comparing paid alternatives to grab attention
- **Clear value proposition**: free, self-hosted DevOps platform
- **Key features** mentioned quickly (CI/CD, Actions, packages)
- **Social proof** with recognizable brands (Google, Mastercard)
- **Quick setup** emphasized as a major selling point
- **Clear CTA** directing to the website

**Production tips:**
- Keep cuts fast-paced to match TikTok/Shorts rhythm

- Use text overlays for key points (helps with sound-off viewers)
- The "2 minutes setup" is a powerful hook - consider showing a real quick install
- End with a clear URL overlay so viewers can find it easily

Would you like me to adjust anything in the script or help with other aspects of the video?
