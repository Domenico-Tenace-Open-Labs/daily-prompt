### 30-Second TikTok/Reels Script: "What is Gitea? The GitHub Alternative You Need!"

**Video Style Tips:**  
- **Length:** Aim for 30 seconds (speak at a natural, energetic pace ~150 words/min).  
- **Visuals:** Start with quick cuts of code typing, server icons, then screen recordings of Gitea dashboard, issue boards, and a fun "vs. GitHub" split-screen. Use upbeat electronic music (royalty-free, like "Tech Vibes"). Text overlays for key phrases. End with a call-to-action sticker.  
- **Hook:** Eye-catching title card: "Tired of GitHub's limits? Meet Gitea! 🚀"  

**Script (Narrate with enthusiasm, on-screen text for emphasis):**

[0-5s: Hook - Show frustrated user on GitHub, cut to Gitea logo]  
"Hey devs! Ever feel locked into GitHub's pricing or privacy woes? Enter Gitea – the free, open-source powerhouse that's basically self-hosted GitHub magic!"

[5-15s: What it is - Quick montage of features]  
"Gitea is a lightweight Git service you run on your own server. Host unlimited private repos, track issues with built-in boards, and even run CI/CD pipelines via Gitea Actions – yep, it works with thousands of GitHub workflows!"

[15-25s: Benefits - Icons popping up: lock for privacy, speedometer for fast, team collab graphic]  
"Key perks? Total data control, lightning-fast performance, and no user or repo limits. It supports 20+ package types like Docker and NPM, integrates with Slack or Jenkins, and runs on Linux, Windows – you name it!"

[25-30s: Close - Split-screen Gitea vs. GitHub, end with link swipe-up]  
"Perfect for teams craving freedom without the bill. Self-host Gitea today at about.gitea.com and level up your DevOps! What's your fave Git tool? Comment below! 👇 #Gitea #OpenSource #DevOps"

**Word Count:** ~145 (Fits 30s perfectly). Test timing with a voiceover app. This keeps it snappy, informative, and shareable – drop it on TikTok and watch the likes roll in! If you need tweaks or a voiceover idea, hit me up.
